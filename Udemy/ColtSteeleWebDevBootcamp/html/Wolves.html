    <p>The wolf (Canis lupus[b]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and
        North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly
        understood, comprise wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also
        distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a
        longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the
        golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown,
        gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.

        Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by
        its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive
        behaviour including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair
        accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and
        in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are
        among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved
        mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have
        higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect
        wolves.

        The global wild wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern by
        the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with
        humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock,
        while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. The wolf is also considered the
        ancestor of the domestic dog. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of
        recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are
        rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of
        their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.</p>
